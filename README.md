# Hardware Starter Kits

Here are some resources to get started with your sensor on [FarmHub](https://farmhub.ag/). This code is provided as-is and can be modified and distributed however you like.

We do not provide hardware support as that is usually done from the supplier.  So please connect with them if you experience any issues.

If you're looking to implement a sensor that isn't listed above, check out our [developer docs](https://docs.farmhub.ag).
